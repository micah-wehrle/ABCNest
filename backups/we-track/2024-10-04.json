In order to move to the back end, we need to decide if the weather alerts are included with the ticket data (may not be a good idea) or if they're just on-demand from the front end. \n\nWe could do a sort of hybrid of both, where the back end when generating a list of tickets will find the weather alerts for the first ticket. We should also look into storing weather alert data (semi permanently? so at least it will persist between server restarts while developing) so that it isn't being called constantly. Then if the user opens a ticket for which they don't have weather data, they can then request it from the back end.",
